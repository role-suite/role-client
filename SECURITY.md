## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Röle seriously. If you find a security vulnerability, please help us fix it by following these steps:

2. Send a report via email to [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL].
3. Includes full details of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue.

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and we will send you a detailed response within 5 days indicating the next steps.

We ask that you:

- Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before disclosure.
- Make a good faith effort to not leak or destroy any data.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid disrupting our services.

Thank you for helping keep Röle safe!
